Introduction
============

The script can be used by itself without integration in Mantis, for example to
produce reports to be sent via email. These are the instructions about how to
run the program to produce the desired output.

Script usage instructions
=========================

If you run the script with the ``-h`` option it prints this brief summary::

  Usage: mantis_statistics.py [options]

  Generate Mantis statistics

  Options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -u USER, --user=USER  User name, or prefix of user names, or comma separated
                          list (no spaces allowed)
    -s, --stats           Display full statistics. Without this flag only
                          expired bugs are displayed
    -f FORMAT, --format=FORMAT
                          Output format: ascii (default), html, htmlstandalone,
                          csv
    -t TRANSITION, --transition=TRANSITION
                          Status transition to be checked; default:
                          assigned,resolved
    -d DAYS, --days=DAYS  Time (in days) after which a bug expires; default:
                          2,4,8
    -l LINK, --link=LINK  Add mantis link to bug id (only for html expired bug
                          report). Put Mantis domain in the value, e.g.:
                          http://eemantis.wki.it

Here follows the detailed description of each option.

-u, --user
----------

Is the list of user names for which statistics should be generated. If there's
only one string then the names are searched using the string as a prefix; e.g.:
"foo" matches "foo" and "foobar". If there are two or more strings separated by
comma characters they are used as exact user names; e.g.: "foo,bar" matches
"foo" and "bar" and nothing else.

-s, --stats
-----------

If specified the output contains the bugs statistics (number of expired and
total bug per month) in months, otherwise the output is the list of the expired
bugs.

-f, --format
------------

Output format. These are the accepted values:

- ascii (default): the output is pure ascii, suitable to be displayed in a
  terminal;
- html: the output is html, but only the content of the <body> tag. This output
  is useful to be included in existing sites, e.g.: Mantis;
- htmlstandalone: the output is a standalone html file containing also the CSS
  definitions;
- csv: the csv format can be easily imported into spreadsheets.

-t, --transition
----------------

The transition to be checked. A transition is specified using the names of the
starting and ending status separated by a comma, e.g.: assigned,resolved. The
allowed names are the ones defined in Mantis, included some custom status you may
have defined.

-d, --days
----------

Time in days after which a bug should be considered expired. These are three
integer values separated by a comma; the default is: 8,4,2. The first value is relative to
bugs with normal priority, the second to bugs with high priority and the last to
bugs with urgent priority.

-l, --link
----------

When the output format is html or htmlstandalone and there's no "-s" flag (so
the output contains the list of expired bugs) this option instructs the program
to add a link around every bug id so that clicking it the browser will be
redirected to the Mantis bug details. The value of this option is the domain
part of the link or, in other words, the domain name you use to access your
Mantis instance.

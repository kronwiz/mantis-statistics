INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

mantis_statistics.py
--------------------

The script ``mantis_statistics.py`` (in the ``bin`` directory) can be put
wherever you want: it works with Python 2 (I use the version 2.7). It uses only
modules contained in the standard library except for the MySQLdb module that you
maybe have to install yourself.

To configure the script you have to change the variables you find at its top to
make it point to your Mantis database instance.

The script can be run with the ``-h`` option to display a summary of the
possible options.


mantis directory
----------------

The content of the ``mantis`` directory should be put in the directory where you
installed your Mantis instance. In detail:

- ``statistics_page.php`` is the form that invokes the ``mantis_statistics.py``
  script;
- ``config_inc.php.sample`` contains the sample configuration that you have to
  add to your ``config_inc.php`` file;
- ``statistics.css`` (in the ``css`` directory) contains the CSS class
  definitions needed by the HTML output: you should copy it in the ``css``
  directory of you Mantis installation.


statistics_page.php
-------------------

This form works out of the box provided that you update the
``mantis_statistics.py`` path in the ``$command`` variable to reflect the
position where you installed it.

Obviously you are free to customize the form as you like.


config_inc.php.sample
---------------------

Shows how to add a custom menu and a custom CSS file to Mantis.
